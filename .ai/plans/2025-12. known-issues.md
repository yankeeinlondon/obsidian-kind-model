# Known Issues

## Stale Renders

- When opening Obsidian the tabs I had opened re-open but the `km` rendering does not happen



## Google Video Previews

- I believe Google changed something about the URL's it uses for shareable video links
- In either case, no code has changed and it DID work but now it looks like:

![broken video previews](./broken-video-previews.png)

```km
VideoGallery()
```

## Silent Errors



## Auto Category / Subcategory Timing
