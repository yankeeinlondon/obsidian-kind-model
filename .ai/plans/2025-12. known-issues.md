# Known Issues

## Stale Renders

- When opening Obsidian the tabs I had opened re-open but the `km` rendering does not happen
- When i bring the cursor to where the `km` block is it shows up
- When I leave the `km` block then it renders it correctly
- See image below

## Google Video Previews

- I believe Google changed something about the URL's it uses for shareable video links
- In either case, no code has changed and it DID work but now it looks like:

### Actual Code Block Definition

```km
VideoGallery()
```

## Silent Errors



## Future Links for Category / Subcategory Pages

- When you use the `update` command on a page which has a tag like `#kind/category/subcategory`. It will link the category and subcategories to defined category/subcategory's for the given _kind_. However, sometimes the category or subcategory definition doesn't exist yet.
- Obsidian handles "future pages" gracefully and in the case of a category/subcategory page not existing yet we still get a link to a page but we link to a "future page"

  ![Example](future-page.png)

	In this image above we have two callouts:

	1. The `#rack/uk` mapped successfully to the category definition
	2. The `#rack/uk/den` did not map to a page so we've added a future page link

	![Example with formatting turned off](future-page-no-formatting.png)

	In the image above we can see the explicit markdown links (and Obsidian based links) that are being defined for the future link. The idea is to provide a **useful** default for the future page. So when a future link is clicked a new page is created:

	![future page created](future-page-created.png)

	Now the user can manually run the `update` command to get this:

	![future page with meta](future-page-with-meta.png)

	Regardless of whether the user decides to rename the page to something else we would should always run this `update` to fill in the frontmatter data. 

	**TASK 1:** We should try to automate this but be forewarned there are timing issues which make this more complicated that make this more complicated then you might imagine. 

	**TASK 2:** Beyond the above automation, it would also be really nice to insert the following `km` query into the page:

	#### For a category page

	```km
	Kind("{{kind}}", "{{category}}")
	```

	#### For a subcategory page

	```km
	Kind("{{kind}}", "{{category}}", "{{subcategory}}")
	```

	This will start the page's definition with a listing of the pages which have associated themselves to this category/subcategory. 

## Classification: Formatting and Non-breakable Spaces

In tabular layout, the `classification` column contains a `>` delimited set of values and when the length of the overall string is greater then the width allotted to the column the line is broken up very badly. 

- The ideal is that all spaces be made non-breaking spaces and that with width for this column is given some priority (though if spaces where non-breaking this might auto-correct the width calculation.

### Multi-Classification

- Another related problem is that while we DO WANT to have new lines for each classification associated to a page. As you can see there is a lot of vertical space wasted. Not sure if it's padding or double spaced but we should present it as a single spaced list of items (no bullet point, just meaning that it should be single spaced).

- the picture shows how a page's multiple classification has too much vertical whitespace.
